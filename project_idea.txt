Project Idea: Online Recipe Sharing Platform

Create an online recipe sharing platform where users can register, create, and share their favorite recipes. Here are some features you can consider implementing:

    User Registration and Authentication: Allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.

    Recipe Creation and Management: Provide a form for users to create and publish their own recipes. Include fields for recipe name, ingredients, preparation steps, cooking time, difficulty level, and tags (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free).

    Recipe Listing and Search: Display a list of recipes on the homepage, allowing users to search and filter recipes based on various criteria (e.g., keyword, category, difficulty level).

    User Interactions: Allow users to like, comment on, and bookmark recipes. Implement features such as a rating system and the ability to save favorite recipes for future reference.

    Social Sharing: Enable users to share recipes on social media platforms or via email.

    User Following: Implement a feature where users can follow other users to receive updates on their latest recipes.

    Recipe Categories and Tags: Organize recipes into categories (e.g., appetizers, desserts, main courses) and allow users to assign tags to their recipes for easy categorization and searching.

    User Dashboard: Provide users with a personalized dashboard where they can manage their own recipes, view their activity feed, and see updates from the users they follow.

    Recipe Recommendations: Implement a recommendation system that suggests recipes based on a user's preferences, past interactions, or popular recipes.

    Admin Panel: Create an admin panel where administrators can manage user accounts, moderate recipes, and perform other administrative tasks.
